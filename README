nezumi
------

nezumi is a simple gopher browser, written in C.
I wrote it in about 3 hours in Go but then realized that Go's tui frameworks are kinda bad (or at least I didn't wanna spend time learning them)
so I rewrote it in C in about 3 more hours.

uses environment vars to determine programs!
$BROWSER to determine browser

see TODO for what's to come
